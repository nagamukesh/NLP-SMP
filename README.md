# Natural Language Processing SMP

This is the repository hosting mentees solutions to the various assignments taksed throughout the IEEE NITK SMP 2024.

## Assignments
Here are links to the various assignments:
- A primer and refresher on [PyTorch](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bolENIURwdVTSxFg_IBfohuQUCijh0X2#scrollTo=DNTlDxZ4C4-R)!

## Instructions to Solve the Assignments
- The assignments are provided in a read-only google colab notebook. You can copy it to your own drive, and either work on it online or on your local machine
- Follow the instructions given. Using AI to solve the assignments (unless explicitly mentioned) is **strictly prohibited**. Instead, feel free to ask us!
- Grading will be based on the clarity of code, demonstration where required, and timely submission. Creativity / ingenuity may earn you some bonus!
- Reach out to us for any doubts, mistakes in questions, or if you want to chat! This SMP is for you :3

## Instructions to Submit the Assignments
- To submit, **make a branch** on this repository.
- Clone this branch on your local machine. You can make commits there, preferably incrementally to show your progress, before pushing to your branch in this repository.
- To this branch, you can upload the progress you have made on your local branch.
- You can also provide links to collab notebooks you may have solved online (if you found that more convinient).
- Please submit the assignment attempts on-time and do justice to the assignments!
