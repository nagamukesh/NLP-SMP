# Assignment for Week 2

We saw how the Spam-Ham dataset was used to train a model that could distinguish between the two. Now, it's your turn to apply the same on a different text dataset of your choice! Here are some examples: 

- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datatattle/email-classification-nlp : This one's an e-mail Spam-Ham dataset as opposed to the earlier SMS Spam-Ham.
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishakhdapat/fake-news-detection : This one's a real/fake news dataset.
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prishasawhney/email-classification-ham-spam : Another e-mail Spam-Ham dataset!

## Instructions to Solve the Assignments
- You must work on either one of these three datasets and create a classifier. Now, while you are free to use the same code (it has a few errors to fix), it is advised that you come up with the entirety on your own. (The notebook is on the Google Site under Resources)
- The classifier result must be in the form of a confusion matrix (one that displays true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives).
- You're free to use whatever vectorization and preprocessing techniques you think will fit best.

## Instructions to Submit the Assignments
- Make a new folder on your branch called **Assignment_Week2** on the same branch. (Please don't crowd the repo with branches)
- Submit your work as a colab notebook (as you won't have to deal with locally downloading packages), dividing your code into four sections - **Data Retrieval, Preprocessing, Vectorization, Model Training**. Try to make it as verbose as possible so that it is easier for us to go through.
- Finally, the work is expected to be submitted by Saturday, i.e., 29 June 2024!
